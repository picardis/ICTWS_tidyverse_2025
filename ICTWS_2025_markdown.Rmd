# Data manipulation, exploration, and visualization made easy: the _tidyverse_ packages

Welcome to the R workshop of the Idaho Chapter of The Wildlife Society meeting 2025!
In this workshop, you will learn how to use functions in the _tidyverse_ 
packages to manipulate, wrangle, and visualize data in an automated way. 
We are going to start by installing and loading the necessary packages. 
The functions we will use to work with data come from the _tidyverse_ library
and the data we will be working on come from the _palmerpenguins_ library. 

```{r hex, echo = FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("palmerpenguins.png")
```

The code below installs the packages onto your computer. This is a one-time step
that won't need to be repeated the next time you want to use these packages. 

```{r pkg-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Now that the packages are installed, we can load them into our R session. This
will need to be repeated every time you restart R and want to use these packages. 

```{r pkg-load, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

The data we will use today comes from an open dataset on three penguin species 
observed in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica, collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman 
with Palmer Station LTER. Let's load the data into our workspace:

```{r data}
data(package = "palmerpenguins")

(p <- penguins_raw)
```

The data comes as a `tibble`. A `tibble` is a tabular object similar to a
`data.frame`, and it is the native form in which tables are displayed in the 
_tidyverse_. They are interoperable, and you can easily convert one into the 
other, but the advantage of tibbles is that they display in a more compact way
in the console without us having to take extra steps to prevent the output to
flood our screen. 

```{r tibbles}
class(p)

p_df <- as.data.frame(p)

head(p_df)

p <- as_tibble(p_df)

head(p)
```

## Learning _tidyverse_ functions

Let's get into the fun part and start learning how to manipulate data using
the _tidyverse_. 

### Selecting columns 

The function `select` allows us to choose only certain columns from a `tibble`. 
For instance, say that we only want to select columns that contain morphometrics
information about individuals:

```{r select}
select(p, 
       "Species", 
       "Individual ID",
       "Culmen Length (mm)",
       "Culmen Depth (mm)",
       "Flipper Length (mm)",
       "Body Mass (g)")
```

### Renaming columns

The column names in this dataset often contain spaces and special characters,
like parentheses. This means I had to do a lot of typing in the previous piece
of code, and I had to wrap column names in quotes. Tidy names contain no spaces
and no special characters, and they allow us to refer to columns in _tidyverse_
without having to put their names in quotes. Let's rename the columns and give
them tidy names: 

```{r rename}
(p <- rename(p, 
            study_name = studyName,
            sample = "Sample Number",
            species = Species,
            region = Region,
            island = Island,
            age_class = Stage,
            ind_id = "Individual ID",
            clutch_comp = "Clutch Completion",
            date_egg = "Date Egg",
            culmen_length_mm = "Culmen Length (mm)",
            culmen_depth_mm = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
            flipper_length_mm = "Flipper Length (mm)",
            body_mass_g = "Body Mass (g)",
            sex = Sex,
            delta_15_n = "Delta 15 N (o/oo)",
            delta_13_c = "Delta 13 C (o/oo)",
            comments = Comments))
```

### Concatenating multiple operations: the pipe 

One of the best features of the tidyverse is the pipe, which looks like this:
`%>%`. The pipe is an operator that allows us to concatenate multiple commands
all in a row, without saving any intermediate objects. The output of the 
previous command becomes the input of the next. You can read the pipe as "then".
For example, in the following code, we take our penguin `data.frame`, _then_ we
turn it into a `tibble`, _then_ we rename the columns, _then_ we select the
columns of interest:

```{r pipe}
(morph <- p_df %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(study_name = studyName,
         sample = "Sample Number",
         species = Species,
         region = Region,
         island = Island,
         age_class = Stage,
         ind_id = "Individual ID",
         clutch_comp = "Clutch Completion",
         date_egg = "Date Egg",
         culmen_length_mm = "Culmen Length (mm)",
         culmen_depth_mm = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
         flipper_length_mm = "Flipper Length (mm)",
         body_mass_g = "Body Mass (g)",
         sex = Sex,
         delta_15_n = "Delta 15 N (o/oo)",
         delta_13_c = "Delta 13 C (o/oo)",
         comments = Comments) %>% 
  select(sample,
         ind_id,
         species,
         sex,
         age_class,
         culmen_length_mm,
         culmen_depth_mm,
         flipper_length_mm, 
         body_mass_g))
```

### Dropping columns 

The `select` function can also be used to drop columns, rather than specifying 
the ones we want to keep. We place a minus sign in front of the columns we want
to get rid of: 

```{r drop}
(morph <- morph %>% 
  select(-sample))
```

### Finding unique combinations

Say that we want to find all the unique combinations of individual ID, species,
and sex that occur in the data. We can combine the `select` function with the
`distinct` function, to return all unique combinations of the specified columns:

```{r distinct}
(ind_info <- p %>% 
  # Columns we want to find unique combinations of
  select(ind_id, species, sex) %>% 
  distinct())
```

### Extracting single columns as vectors

Now, let's say that we want to check how many different individual IDs exist
in the data. In this case, rather than a combination of columns, we only want to
find unique values in one column. The function `distinct` works on a `tibble`,
while the function `unique` (which is not a _tidyverse_ function, but a base R
function), wants a vector as input. For this reason, using `select` before 
`unique` is not going to work. The function we want to use instead is `pull`. 
This function returns a single column as a vector. For instance, let's see how
many unique individual IDs exist in the data:

```{r pull}
p %>% 
  pull(ind_id) %>% 
  unique()
```

There are 190 unique IDs. However, the number of unique combinations of ID,
species, and sex has more rows than that (298). This means there are repeated
IDs in the data! What is going on?

### Filtering data 

Let's take a look, for instance, at the ID N11A1. We can use the function
`filter` to subset the rows that have that ID: 

```{r filter}
ind_info %>% 
  filter(ind_id == "N11A1")
```

It looks like this same ID was assigned to two individuals of different species.
How can we find all the individual IDs that are repeated in the data?

### Grouping and doing operations by group

To find out which IDs are repeated, we can count the number of rows each 
individual ID appears in. We can do that by grouping rows by individual IDs
and then counting the number of rows in each group:

```{r group}
ind_info %>% 
  group_by(ind_id) %>% 
  tally()
```

### Sorting results 

If we want to know how many times, at most, IDs are repeated, we can sort the
results of the counts by group:

```{r arrange1}
ind_info %>% 
  group_by(ind_id) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(n)
```

That didn't quite work... it sorted results in ascending order, so all we were
able to see at a glance is that the IDs with the fewest repetitions are only 
used once. But what we want to do is look at the IDs with the most repetitions 
and find out how many times they were used. We can reverse the order:

```{r arrange2}
ind_info %>% 
  group_by(ind_id) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

It turns out that, at most, the same ID was reused three times. Here is how to
find all the IDs that were used more than once:

```{r repeated}
ind_info %>% 
  group_by(ind_id) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

### Creating new columns 

Having a column that uniquely identifies each individual is very useful, so
we're going to create a new column that contains a new individual ID, with no
repetitions. For example, we can create a column with the prefix "ID" followed
by an incremental number:

```{r mutate}
(ind_info <- ind_info %>% 
  mutate(new_id = paste0("ID", 1:nrow(.))))
```

### Conditional value assignment 

Alternatively, if we wanted something more sophisticated and we did not want
to lose the original ID that was assigned to each individual, we can append
to it the initial of the species and the initial of the sex. Each combination
of original ID, species, and sex will now be uniquely identifiable. To do this,
we use the function `mutate` that we saw above and we combine it with the 
function `case_when`, which performs conditional value assignment. We make a
series of logical statements and specify the value that should be in the new
column depending on whether those statements are true:

```{r case_when}
(ind_info <- ind_info %>% 
  mutate(species_initial = case_when(
    species == "Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)" ~ "A",
    species == "Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)" ~ "G",
    species == "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)" ~ "C"
  ),
  sex_initial = case_when(
    sex == "MALE" ~ "M",
    sex == "FEMALE" ~ "F",
    is.na(sex) ~ "U"
  )) %>% 
  mutate(new_id = paste(ind_id, species_initial, sex_initial, sep = "_")) %>% 
  select(-species_initial, -sex_initial))
```

Let's check that now there are as many new IDs as there are rows in the 
individual information table:

```{r check}
length(unique(ind_info$new_id)) == nrow(ind_info)
```

Great. We're good to go! 

### Joining tables

Now we want to make sure that the new ID column appears in the morphometrics 
table, too. We could either repeat the operation above on this table and 
recreate the individual ID, or we could append the new column by matching 
combinations of individual ID, species, and sex. Let's do the latter:

```{r left_join1}
left_join(morph, ind_info)
```

If we don't specify which columns we want to join by, `left_join` will 
automatically choose all the columns that share the same name in both tables.
We could decide instead to join based on a subset of those, for example,
the individual ID. What happens if we do that?

```{r left_join2}
left_join(morph, ind_info, by = "ind_id")
```

This is not quite what we wanted. We ended up with way too many rows, because
some individual IDs appear in combination with different species, sexes, or
new IDs. So, the first output we got was actually correct. But this goes to show
how important it is to be explicit about which columns we want to join tables by.
Let's explicitly say that we want to join the tables based on combinations of 
individual ID, species, and sex:

```{r left_join3}
(morph <- left_join(morph, ind_info, by = c("ind_id", "species", "sex")))
```

### Relocating columns 

It's useful to have the individual ID be on the left hand side of the table. 
Let's move the column we just created. Based on personal preference, we could
place it, for instance, after the original individual ID or before it:

```{r relocate}
morph %>% 
  relocate(new_id, .after = ind_id)

morph <- morph %>% 
  relocate(new_id, .before = ind_id)
```

### Limiting results and subsetting rows by position

It is useful to be able to look at just a subset of the rows. For example, we 
might just want to see the first row of a dataset; we might just want to see the 
first three; we might want to see a specific subset of non-consecutive rows;
or we might want to see the first row for each group (e.g., for each species,
or for each combination of species and sex). The `slice` funciton can do all of
those things:

```{r slice}
morph %>% 
  slice(1)

morph %>% 
  slice(1:3)

morph %>% 
  slice(c(1, 3, 10, 25))

morph %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  slice(1)

morph %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  slice(1)
```

### Putting it all together

With just a handful of _tidyverse_ functions, we have now built a pretty 
powerful toolbox that allows us to manipulate data to change its format or to
answer questions about it. Let's practice with a few tasks.

#### Task 1

Count how many individuals, within each combination of species and sex, weigh
more than 4 kilograms.

```{r task1}
(over4kg <- morph %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) %>% 
  filter(body_mass_kg > 4) %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  tally())
```

#### Task 2

Formulate the previous values as proportions of the total number of individuals
for each combination of species and sex.

```{r task2}
(n_by_species_sex <- morph %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  tally())

(over4kg %>% 
  left_join(n_by_species_sex, by = c("species", "sex")) %>% 
  rename(n_4kg = n.x, n = n.y) %>% 
  mutate(prop_4kg = n_4kg/n))
```

#### Task 3

It looks like Gentoo penguins are generally much bigger than Adelie and 
Chinstrap. How to they compare in terms of flipper length? Calculate the 
minimum, mean, and maximum flipper length for each species.

```{r task3}
morph %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(min = min(flipper_length_mm),
            mean = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            max = max(flipper_length_mm))

morph %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(min = min(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            max = max(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Data visualization with ggplot2 

The `ggplot2` package allows us to produce beautiful data visualizations, even
quite complex ones in an automated and simple way. 
  
The logic of `ggplot` follows the "Grammar of Graphics" framework, which was 
first introduced in a book by Leland Wilkinson. This framework concisely 
describes the different components of a graphic. At a minimum, a plot is 
composed of data, aesthetics, and geometries: 

* Data: this is the data that are represented on a plot;
* Aesthetics: these are the variables that are represented on the plot (e.g., 
what goes on the axes, or what is encoded with different symbols and colors);
* Geometries: these are the actual symbols that appear on the plot (points,
lines, etc.)

On top of these fundamental components, there can be additional elements for 
customization. The plot is initialized using the `ggplot` function, and all 
elements get added as layers connected by `+` signs. 

### Boxplot of body mass by species

Let's make a boxplot of penguin body mass by species. Here, our data is the 
penguin dataset. Our aesthetics include the variable on the x axis (the species),
the variable on the y axis (the body mass), and the color of our boxplots (which
will be in different colors depending on the species). The geometries on the 
plot will be the boxplots and the original data points (jittered a little bit 
so that they are not all on top of each other). Since the species names are 
already on the x axis, the legend is redundant and we can remove it. We complete 
the plot with a clean theme, nice axis labels, and a nice color palette. 

```{r plot1, out.width="100%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(p, aes(y = body_mass_g, x = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Body mass (g)", color = "Species") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

### Density plot of flipper length by species

Let's make a density plot of penguin flipper length by species. Again, our data 
is the penguin dataset. The aesthetics include the variable on the x axis (the
flipper length) and the variable that we will use to assign a fill color to 
each density curve (the species). Because this is a density plot, the variable
on the y axis will be the density, which is calculated automatically by
`geom_density` and we do not need to specify that in the aesthetics. We then
add our geometry (the density curves). We complete the plot with a clean theme,
nice axis labels, and a nice color palette, and we customize the position of the
legend on the plot. 

```{r plot2, out.width="100%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(p, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Density", fill = "Species") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

### Scatterplot of isotopic values by species and island 

Let's make a scatterplot of isotopic values (carbon and nitrogen) for penguins
by species and island. Here, the aesthetics will be the two isotope variables 
on the x and y axes, and the species as the color variable. Our geometries will
be points, and we will have a different panel for each island. We complete the 
plot with a clean theme, nice axis labels, and a color palette. 

```{r plot3, out.width="100%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(p, aes(x = delta_13_c, y = delta_15_n, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ island) +
  labs(x = "Delta 13C", y = "Delta 15N", color = "Species") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

### Scatterplot of culmen depth and length by body mass and species

Presumably, larger penguins will simultaneously have longer limbs and higher
body mass. Let's see if this holds true by making a scatterplot of culmen
depth and length by body mass and species. Here, our x and y aesthetics will be
the culmen length and depth, respectively. The color aesthetic will be the 
species. We can add an additional aesthetic by making the size of the points 
vary with the value of body mass. We complete the plot with a clean theme, nice 
axis labels, and a nice color palette. Notice that in this case, I changed the 
order in which I specified the customization options, because it does not matter
which order they get added in. 

```{r plot4, out.width="100%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(p, aes(x = culmen_length_mm, y = culmen_depth_mm, 
              color = species, size = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  labs(x = "Culmen length (mm)", y = "Culmen depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", size = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Adding regression lines with confidence intervals

A common scenario is wanting to create a plot of our data overlaid to the 
output of a model, for instance, a linear regression. To do that, we have to 
take a few extra steps before we can create the plot. First, we need to run a
regression model and generate predictions from it. 

```{r plot5-prep}
mod <- lm(culmen_depth_mm ~ culmen_length_mm * species, data = p)

new_data <- expand.grid(species = factor(unique(p$species)),
            culmen_length_mm = seq(min(p$culmen_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
                                   max(p$culmen_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
                                   length.out = 100))

preds <- predict(mod, newdata = new_data, se.fit = TRUE)

res <- new_data %>% 
  mutate(culmen_depth_mm = preds$fit,
         culmen_depth_lwr_ci = preds$fit - preds$se.fit * 1.96,
         culmen_depth_upr_ci = preds$fit + preds$se.fit * 1.96)
```

Now we are ready to plot. We can take the code from the previous plot and 
include a ribbon for the confidence intervals and a line for the mean prediction
in addition to the points for the raw data. Because we want the size aesthetic
to only apply to the points, we will move it from the general `ggplot` function
into the appropriate layer. Note that, in this plot, we are combining two 
datasets: the raw penguin data (for the points) and the predictions table (for
the line and ribbon). We can specify different datasets in different layers.
The names of the x and y variables, as well as the name of the color variable, 
are the same in both data frames, so we can define those aesthetics in the main
`ggplot` layer. For the ribbon layer, we will need to add three more aesthetics:
the minimum y value at which the ribbon should start, the maximum y value at
which it should end, and the color we want the inside of the ribbon to be. We 
can add some transparency to make sure we can still see the line on top of it. 
In this case, we have both a color and a fill variable for different components
of the plot, so we want to specify the same palette for both. Notice that, in
this case, it was important to add the layers in the right order because we 
needed the line to be on top of the ribbon, which in turn is on top of the 
points, for everything to be visible. We complete the plot with a clean theme 
and nice axis labels. 

```{r plot5, out.width="100%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(p, aes(x = culmen_length_mm, y = culmen_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = res, 
              mapping = aes(ymin = culmen_depth_lwr_ci,
                            ymax = culmen_depth_upr_ci,
                            fill = species),
              alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(data = res) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  labs(x = "Culmen length (mm)", y = "Culmen depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", fill = "Species", size = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Scatterplot of flipper and culmen length by body mass and sex (Adelie only)

We can seamlessly combine the _tidyverse_ syntax we learned in the first part 
of the workshop with `ggplot2` functions. Let's make an example of that by 
creating a scatterplot of flipper and culmen length by body mass and sex for 
Adelie penguins only. Instead of filtering Adelie penguins and creating a
separate object for that subset of data, we can directly pipe our filtered
dataset into the `ggplot` function, and it will be used as the input data. We
will also get rid of individuals for which the sex was not recorded. Then, we
specify our aesthetics: culmen and flipper length go on the x and y axes,
respectively, and the points will be colored depending on the value of body 
mass. Notice that this is the first time we use a continuous color palette. 
We separate sexes into two different panels. We increase the size of the points.
We complete the plot with a clean theme and nice axis labels.

```{r plot6, out.width="100%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p %>% 
  filter(grepl("Adelie", species) &
           !is.na(sex)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = culmen_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, 
              color = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = "Culmen length (mm)", y = "Flipper length (mm)",
       color = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_bw()
```
